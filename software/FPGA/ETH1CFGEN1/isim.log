Simulator is doing circuit initialization process.
Block Memory Generator CORE Generator module test_ETH1CFGEN1.test.blk_mem.inst.\native_mem_module.blk_mem_gen_v7_3_inst  is using a behavioral model for simulation which will not precisely model memory collision behavior.
WARNING: Behavioral models for independent clock FIFO configurations do not model synchronization delays. The behavioral models are functionally correct, and will represent the behavior of the configured FIFO. See the FIFO Generator User Guide for more information.
Finished circuit initialization process.
